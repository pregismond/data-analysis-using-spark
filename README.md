## Project Scenario

As a data engineer, I’ve been assigned by our HR department to design a robust data pipeline capable of ingesting employee data in CSV format. My responsibilities include analyzing the data, implementing necessary transformations, and enabling the extraction of valuable insights from the processed data.

## Objectives

* Create a DataFrame from a CSV file
* Define a schema for the data
* Perform transformations and actions using Spark SQL

## Setup

Install the required libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file. The command syntax is:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the required employees csv file using the terminal command:

```bash
wget https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-BD0225EN-SkillsNetwork/data/employees.csv
```
